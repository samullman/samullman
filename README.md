## Sam Ullman
We're taking back over.  Power to the people.  Institutions are telling us how to think, read, eat, sleep, marry, and live and I think individuals do a better job themselves.  My mission is to empower people to stand up for themselves and others.  We're in this together.  Let's stand together. 

I have been developing websites for over 5 years.  I currently use Svelte/SvelteKit for building apps.  I've used React/Next.js and React/Gatsby.js.

[Get in touch](mailto:samullman@gmail.com) about building technology with any of these things.
