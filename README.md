# Sam Ullman
Web & business developer based in Austin, TX!  I'm leveraging powerful web technologies for agencies, businesses, and startups!

[Get in touch](mailto:samullman@gmail.com).  Let's build something great! 

## Current Work
I'm currently developing React.js, Next.js, Gatsby, and Svelte applications, particularly connected to Web3 resources and blockchains! I have experience developing custom UIs, E-commerce interfaces, and more with styled-components, animations, and most other frontend technologies. I've worked with many Headless-CMS systems, Shopify and other E-commerce engines, and realtime databases
